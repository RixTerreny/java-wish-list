# java-wish-list
Welcome to the java-wish-list repository! This repository contains a Java program that allows users to create and manage their Christmas wish list. The program provides an interactive interface for adding gifts to the list, displaying the list's length after each addition, and sorting the list in ascending order.

 ## Features
- Add Gifts: Users can enter the name of a gift to add to the wish list. The program will store the gifts in an ArrayList.

- Display Length: After each gift addition, the program will display the current length of the wish list. This provides users with real-time feedback.

- Sorting: Once the user decides to stop adding gifts, the program will sort the wish list in ascending order. This ensures that the gifts are presented in an organized manner.

- Printing: The sorted wish list will be printed to the console, allowing users to see the final list.

Bonus: File Persistence: The program offers the option to save the wish list to a file. This allows users to retrieve their previous wish lists when restarting the program.
